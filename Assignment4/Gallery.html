            conditions and sedimentary deposits over time, the mountain’s unique minerology created a marbling effect,
            with layered

        <p>Railay Beach is, in fact, a small peninsula which counts four beaches. ... In just one small peninsula you'll
            find
            gorgeous white sand beaches, soaring limestone cliffs, viewpoints, caves and a lagoon hidden inside the
            cliffs, shaped
            and fed by the changing tides.</p>

        <p>The aurora borealis – otherwise known as the northern lights – is a vivid demonstration of the Earth's
            magnetic field
            interacting with charged particles from the sun. It's also beautiful, and worth braving a cold night out
            when visiting
            the high northern (or southern) latitudes.</p>
